Terraform/OpenTofu provider for managing [Atlassian Cloud](https://www.atlassian.com/cloud) (Jira + Confluence) configuration as infrastructure as code. Supports projects, permission schemes, workflows, issue types, custom fields, screens, roles, and Confluence spaces — with full import and drift detection.

**[View on Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/lbajsarowicz/atlassian/latest)** — full documentation, installation instructions, and version history.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) >= 1.0 or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/) >= 1.6
- Go >= 1.25 (for development only)

## Installation

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    atlassian = {
      source  = "bmp-cloud/atlassian"
      version = "~> 0.3"
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Terraform and OpenTofu resolve `lbajsarowicz/atlassian` to their respective registries automatically. Lock files will differ between the two tools because the signing chains are different.

## Authentication

Provider configuration takes precedence over environment variables.

  user  = "admin@example.com"
  token = "your-api-token"
}
```
